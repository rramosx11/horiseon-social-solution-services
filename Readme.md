# Description 

In this challenge I was tasked with refactoring the code for Horiseon, a financial marketing company. I updated the HTML and CSS in an effort to optimaize the website's code.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```

## Updates

* Changed the title from website to Horiseon
* Added semantic elemnents through the HTML
* Changed the h3 tags to h2 tags to fix the hierarchy of the headers.
* Removed the extra class titles and adjusted the CSS to condense the code in html and css.
* Reordered the css to follow the structure of the webpage.
* Added alt descriptions to the images
* Fixed the navigation bar so that when the tab in clicked on the website, the viewer will be redirected to that section of the page. The id was missing for the SEO section.
